# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and generate insights into how different factors influence campaign outcomes. These findings will be presented using charts and graphs to provide Louise with essential information at a glance. Visualizations aid in uncovering a link or trend within a dataset, but depict the findings in a simple, user-friendly way.

## Analysis and Challenges
**Analysis:** Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

**Challenges:**

## Analysis Results 
To determine if other Kickstarter campaigns were able to come close to their fundrasing goals in a short amount of time, two main factors were analyzed:

  1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  2. Outcomes Based on Goals
  
### Part One: Analyzing Outcomes Based on Launch Date for Theater Parent Category  
The line graph below tells us a few important factors that will help Louise in her campaigning.

**Observations:** 
* The length of the campaign and its' launch date do play an important role in campaign success.
    - May and June are the best months to launch Theater campaigns
    - December is the worst month to launch 
**Recommendations:** 
    - Louise should launch her campaign in May or June to maximize her chances of being successful. 
    
### Part Two: Analyzing Outcomes Based on Goals for Plays Subcategory
- The line graph below, visualizes the percentage of successful/failed/canceled campaigns based on their fundraising goals.

*This figure is helpful in visualizing how **Too High** of a goal or **Too Low** of a goal may impact the outcome of a campaign. In order to see this information more clearly, take a look at the Box and Whisker Plot below*

- Louise was looking at musicals in Europe. The box plot includes helpful information to Louise, in order for her to start her next endeavor.

  * The mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed kickstarters are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money.
  * Louise should keep her fundraising goal below $4,999 to increase her chances of being successful.
  
### Part Three: Final Recommendations, and Limitations of the data
  1. The data being analyzed is from 2014-2016. To have a better understanding and ability to provide more accurate information to Louise, data from more recent years should be used. 
  2. To be able to provide Louise with a better analysis, we should know how long she plans or is willing to have her campaign live.
  3. Lastly, information such as, how many of the backers that were active at the time of these reports, are still actively donating - and how many of those backers have been known to donate to her interests and location.
