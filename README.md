# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and generate insights into how different factors influence campaign outcomes. These findings will be presented using charts and graphs to provide Louise with essential information at a glance. Visualizations aid in uncovering a link or trend within a dataset, but depict the findings in a simple, user-friendly way.

  * The length of the campaign and its' launch date do play an important role in campaign success.
    - May and June are the best months to launch
    - December is the worst month to launch
